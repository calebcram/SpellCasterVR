# SpellCasterVR
This is a simple VR prototype game in which the player can can cast spells using different VR control scheme combinations to shoot down enemy bats on two different stages. If the first stage is completed, the player progresses to the second stage, where the game will continue indefinitely. If the player gets hit by bats too many times, they have to restart from the beginning.  There are 4 unique spells at the player's disposal. The fire attack is a basic ranged attack that can be fired using the right trigger button. The water attack uses the left trigger button and pushes enemies back, helping the user buy time. The wind attack is a powerful ranged attack that can be created when the user puts both hands together. The lightning attack is created by holding the "A" button and making a forward throwing motion with the right arm. It is the most powerful attack but also the most difficult to control.  Channel basic spells such as fire and water. Do more complicated motions to channel electricity and wind. Utilize motion to create a dynamic combat flow in which the player can immersively combine spells for powerful attacks.
